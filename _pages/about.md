I am a BSc Kinesiology Student at the Univeristy of Calgary. In addition, I am an RA for the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Research Associates Program at the Alberta Childrenâ€™s Hospital. I also work as a lifeguard for the City of Calgary Recreation.
In my free time I compete in track and field for the Univeristy of Calgary Athletics Club in sprints and jumps.
I am also the Dinos Rowing team record holder for the lightweight mens peak power and 1 minute erg tests.
